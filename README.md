# ROPE

ROPE is a tool for forecasting upper-atmosphere density. Given a start time and a forecast window, it produces a 3-D grid of density and uncertainty estimates that can be queried at any point within the grid.

## Notices

This is a beta release of the ROPE tool. It is not recommended for use in production until the full version is released. Breaking changes to the public API may be introduced during the beta testing phase.

## Contact Info

Contact [Violet Player](mailto:violet.player@noaa.gov) or [Piyush Mehta](mailto:piyush.mehta@mail.wvu.edu) with any questions. Technical support questions should be directed to [Violet Player](mailto:violet.player@noaa.gov).

## Requirements

- Linux (x86_64, glibc 2.31+), macOS 12+, or Windows 10+
- Python 3.8+ (python wrapper only)

## Installation

Download the release archive for your platform and hardware from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ASSISTLabOrg/rope-framework/releases).

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Linux, CPU | `rope_framework-<version>-linux-x86_64-cpu.tar.gz` |
| Linux, CUDA 12 | `rope_framework-<version>-linux-x86_64-cuda12.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `rope_framework-<version>-macos-arm64-cpu.tar.gz` |
| Windows, CPU | `rope_framework-<version>-windows-x64-cpu.zip` |
| Windows, CUDA 12 | `rope_framework-<version>-windows-x64-cuda12.zip` |

**Currently Unsupported:** macOS (Intel), Linux (ARM64), ROCm, CUDA 13+

Extract the archive. The layout inside is:

```
rope_framework-<version>-<platform>/
    bin/        rope executable
    lib/        runtime libraries
    config/     rope.conf
    data/       models/ and drivers/ (download separately)
    include/    C API header (rope.h)
```

**macOS only:** After extracting, macOS Gatekeeper will block the bundled `.dylib` files with `library load disallowed by system policy`. Clear the quarantine attribute before use:

```
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine rope_framework-<version>-macos-arm64-cpu/
```

**Download models and data separately.** The `data/` directory (model artifacts and driver data) is not included in the release archive. Download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gVQ0gqzwfKDaZIuT8tWoCyWQOL_hT4Ol?usp=drive_link) and place it inside the extracted folder alongside `bin/` and `lib/`.

Once in place the directory structure should look like the layout above.

## Configuration

The default config file is `config/rope.conf`. It is pre-configured to match the standard layout, so in most cases nothing needs to be changed.

If you need to change paths or thread counts, open the file in a text editor. The settings are documented with comments inside it.

The one setting you may want to change is `decoder.device`:

```
[decoder]
device = cpu    # or: cuda, cuda:0, cuda:1
```

This only has an effect on builds that include the LibTorch backend (the CPU and CUDA 12 Linux builds, and the macOS build).

## Command Line Interface

All commands are run through the `rope` executable in `bin/`. On Linux and macOS you may need to prefix commands with `./bin/rope` if the directory is not on your PATH.

### 1. Run a forecast

```
rope forecast --start "2024-06-01 00:00:00" --horizon 24
```

Runs a 24-hour forecast starting at the given UTC time and writes the resulting grid to a cache file. A second `rope forecast` fully replaces the cached grid.

`--start` accepts `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` in UTC.

### 2. Query a point

```
rope get --mode interp --time "2024-06-01T06:00:00" --lst 12.5 --lat 45.0 --alt 400.0
```

Returns density and uncertainty at the requested position, interpolated from the cached forecast.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--mode interp` | Interpolate in time between model hours |
| `--mode hold` | Snap to the next model hour (no time blending) |
| `--time` | UTC time within the forecast window |
| `--lst` | Local Solar Time, hours [0, 24) |
| `--lat` | Geodetic latitude, degrees [-87.5, 87.5] |
| `--alt` | Altitude, km [100, 980] |

Output is a JSON object on stdout:

```json
{"density": 4.72e-12, "uncertainty": 3.5e-13}
```

Density and uncertainty are in kg/m³.

### Batch queries

To query many points at once, prepare a CSV file with the columns `YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MIN,SS,lst,lat,alt_km` and pass it with `--file`:

```
rope get --mode interp --file queries.csv --output results.csv
```

### Use a non-default config

```
rope forecast --config /path/to/rope.conf --start "2024-06-01 00:00:00" --horizon 24
```

### Export as Zarr

```
rope forecast --start "2024-06-01 00:00:00" --horizon 24 --zarr /path/to/output_dir
```

`--zarr` names a container directory; the store lands at `<path>/forecast_<start>_H<horizon>/`. Read it with `xarray.open_dataset(path, engine="zarr")`.

## Python

A Python wrapper is included in the `python/` directory. Copy `rope.py` to your project or add `python/` to your Python path. Requires Python 3.8 or later and no additional packages.

### Setup

```python
from rope import Rope

# Paths are resolved automatically from the archive layout.
# Pass explicit paths if your layout differs.
r = Rope(
    lib_path="lib/librope.so",   # or .dylib / .dll
    exe_path="bin/rope",
    config_path="config/rope.conf",
)
```

The constructor parameters are all optional. When omitted, `rope.py` resolves them relative to the directory one level above its own location (the archive root).

To override the decoder device (e.g. to switch between CPU and GPU) without editing `rope.conf`, pass `device="cuda"`. The wrapper writes a temporary config with that setting and passes it to the forecast subprocess.

### Example

```python
from rope import Rope, ROPE_INTERP, ROPE_HOLD

r = Rope()

# 1. Run a forecast (writes the cache file).
result = r.forecast("2024-06-01 00:00:00", horizon=24)
print(result["window_start"], "→", result["window_end"])

# 2. Query a single point.
#    The 'with' block opens an interpolation handle on entry and closes it on exit.
with r:
    pt = r.get(time="2024-06-01T07:00:00Z", lst=12.5, lat=45.0, alt_km=400.0)
    print(pt)  # {'density': 4.72e-12, 'uncertainty': 3.5e-13}

# 3. Query many points at once.
with r:
    pts = r.get_batch(
        times=["2024-06-01T07:00:00Z", "2024-06-01T08:00:00Z"],
        lsts=[12.5, 6.0],
        lats=[45.0, -30.0],
        alts_km=[400.0, 300.0],
        mode=ROPE_INTERP,
    )
    for p in pts:
        print(p["density"], p["uncertainty"])

# 4. Tight-loop use: get_density() returns a bare float with no dict allocation.
with r:
    for t in my_timestamps:
        rho = r.get_density(t, lst=0.0, lat=0.0, alt_km=400.0)

# 5. Release the handle when done (unmaps the cache file).
r.shutdown()
```

The `with` block calls `open()` on entry and `close()` on exit. `shutdown()` is an alias for `close()`, also called automatically on interpreter exit.

### Time formats

`forecast()`, `get()`, and `get_batch()` all accept query times in any of these forms:

- **Unix timestamp** (float): `1717225200.0`
- **ISO 8601 string**: `"2024-06-01T07:00:00"`, `"2024-06-01T07:00:00Z"`, `"2024-06-01 07:00:00"`
- **`datetime` object**: timezone-aware or naive (naive is treated as UTC)

### API summary

| Member | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Rope(lib_path, exe_path, cache_path, config_path, device)` | Constructor — all parameters optional |
| `forecast(start, horizon)` → `dict` | Run a forecast; returns `{"status", "window_start", "window_end"}` |
| `open()` | Memory-map the cached grid and open an interpolation handle |
| `close()` | Release the handle (unmaps the cache file) |
| `refresh()` | Re-map the cache file after a new forecast |
| `get(time, lst, lat, alt_km, mode)` → `dict` | Single-point query; returns `{"density", "uncertainty"}` in kg/m³ |
| `get_density(time, lst, lat, alt_km, mode)` → `float` | Single-point density only; faster for tight loops |
| `get_batch(times, lsts, lats, alts_km, mode)` → `list[dict]` | N-point query; returns list of `{"density", "uncertainty"}` |
| `shutdown()` | Alias for `close()` |
| `device` | Property: active decoder device string |

**Mode constants:** `ROPE_INTERP` (1, default) — interpolate in time; `ROPE_HOLD` (0) — snap to next model hour.

Errors are raised as `RopeError(RuntimeError)` with a `.code` attribute matching the `ROPE_ERR_*` values and a message that includes the error name (e.g. `[time out of range] ...`).

## C API

For use from C or languages with a C FFI, `include/rope/capi/rope.h` exposes a stable C-compatible ABI. The shared library is `lib/librope.so` (Linux), `lib/librope.dylib` (macOS), or `bin/librope.dll` (Windows).

The C API handles interpolation only — it memory-maps the cache file written by `rope forecast`. Run forecasts through the `rope` CLI.

### Functions

```c
/* Open a handle onto the forecast-grid cache file (memory-mapped).
 * Returns NULL on failure; err_buf is filled with the reason. */
rope_interp_t* rope_open(const char* cache_path, char* err_buf, int err_len);

/* Query a single point. Returns ROPE_OK (0) on success. */
int rope_query(rope_interp_t* interp, int mode,
               double time_unix, double lst, double lat, double alt_km,
               double* density, double* uncertainty,
               char* err_buf, int err_len);

/* Query N points in one call. Fills density[] and uncertainty[]. */
int rope_query_batch(rope_interp_t* interp, int mode, int n,
                     const double* times_unix, const double* lst,
                     const double* lat, const double* alt_km,
                     double* density, double* uncertainty,
                     char* err_buf, int err_len);

/* Release the handle (unmaps the cache file). Safe to call with NULL. */
void rope_close(rope_interp_t* interp);
```

**Mode constants:** `ROPE_HOLD` (0) — snap to nearest model hour; `ROPE_INTERP` (1) — interpolate in time.

**Return codes:**

| Code | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `ROPE_OK` | 0 | Success |
| `ROPE_ERR_NO_FORECAST` | 2 | No forecast cached at this path — run `rope forecast` first |
| `ROPE_ERR_TIME_RANGE` | 3 | Query time outside forecast window |
| `ROPE_ERR_SPATIAL_RANGE` | 4 | Query point outside grid bounds |
| `ROPE_ERR_BAD_ARG` | 5 | Invalid argument (NULL pointer, etc.) |
| `ROPE_ERR_INTERNAL` | 6 | Unexpected internal failure |
| `ROPE_ERR_CACHE_CORRUPT` | 7 | Cache file exists but is corrupt or from an incompatible build |

### Example

```c
#include "rope/capi/rope.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void) {
    char err[256];

    /* 1. Start a forecast from the CLI before calling rope_open. */

    /* 2. Open interpolation handle. */
    rope_interp_t* r = rope_open(NULL, err, sizeof(err));
    if (!r) { fprintf(stderr, "rope_open: %s\n", err); return 1; }

    /* 3. Query a single point. */
    double density, uncertainty;
    double time_unix = 1717225200.0; /* 2024-06-01T07:00:00 UTC */
    int rc = rope_query(r, ROPE_INTERP, time_unix,
                        12.5, 45.0, 400.0,
                        &density, &uncertainty, err, sizeof(err));
    if (rc != ROPE_OK) { fprintf(stderr, "rope_query: %s\n", err); }
    else printf("density=%.3e  uncertainty=%.3e kg/m3\n", density, uncertainty);

    /* 4. Release handle. */
    rope_close(r);
    return rc;
}
```

Compile and link against the shared library:

```
# Linux
gcc -Iinclude example.c -Llib -lrope -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../lib' -o example

# macOS
clang -Iinclude example.c -Llib -lrope -rpath @loader_path/../lib -o example

# Windows (MSVC)
cl /I include example.c /link /LIBPATH:bin rope.lib /out:example.exe
```

## C# (.NET)

A C# binding is included in the `dotnet/` directory and published as the `RopeFramework` NuGet package. It targets .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8, and works on all supported platforms.

Interpolation queries call `librope` in-process; forecasts run via the `rope` CLI as a subprocess.

### Setup

`RopeFramework` isn't on nuget.org — install the downloaded `.nupkg` as a local package source instead; this is the expected way to consume the binding.

Download `RopeFramework.<version>.nupkg` from the GitHub Releases page, then either add it via the NuGet Package Manager (Visual Studio: Tools → NuGet Package Manager → Package Sources → add the folder, then install `RopeFramework` as usual) or from the CLI (works for both PackageReference and packages.config projects):

```
dotnet add package RopeFramework --source /path/to/folder
```

Either way, native binaries are bundled in the package and copied next to your build output automatically — no extra setup needed.

Alternatively, reference the project directly or copy `Rope.cs` into your project:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="path/to/dotnet/Rope.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Usage

```csharp
using RopeFramework;

// Paths are resolved automatically from the package layout.
// Pass explicit paths if your layout differs.
var r = new Rope(
    libPath: "lib/librope.so",   // or .dylib / .dll
    exePath: "bin/rope",
    configPath: "config/rope.conf"
);

// Run a forecast (writes the cache file).
var forecast = r.Forecast("2024-06-01 00:00:00", horizon: 24);
Console.WriteLine($"Window: {forecast.WindowStart} → {forecast.WindowEnd}");

// Open an interpolation handle and query.
r.Open();
var result = r.Get(
    time: new DateTime(2024, 6, 1, 7, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc),
    lst: 12.5, lat: 45.0, altKm: 400.0,
    mode: Rope.Interp
);
Console.WriteLine($"density={result.Density:e3}  uncertainty={result.Uncertainty:e3} kg/m³");

// Batch query.
var times = new[] {
    new DateTime(2024, 6, 1, 7, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc),
    new DateTime(2024, 6, 1, 8, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc),
};
var results = r.GetBatch(times,
    lsts:   [12.5, 6.0],
    lats:   [45.0, -30.0],
    altsKm: [400.0, 300.0]);

// Dispose closes the interpolation handle (unmaps the cache file).
r.Dispose();
```

### API summary

| Member | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Rope(libPath, exePath, cachePath, configPath)` | Constructor — all parameters optional; defaults derived from package layout |
| `Forecast(string start, int horizon)` | Run a forecast; returns `ForecastResult` with `WindowStart` / `WindowEnd` |
| `Forecast(DateTime start, int horizon)` | DateTime overload |
| `Open()` | Memory-map the cached grid and open an interpolation handle |
| `Close()` | Release the handle (unmaps the cache file) |
| `Refresh()` | Re-map the cache file after a new forecast |
| `Get(double timeUnix, ...)` | Single-point query; returns `QueryResult` with `Density` and `Uncertainty` |
| `Get(DateTime time, ...)` | DateTime overload |
| `GetBatch(double[] timesUnix, ...)` | Batch query; returns `QueryResult[]` |
| `GetBatch(DateTime[] times, ...)` | DateTime overload |
| `Shutdown()` | Alias for `Close()` |
| `Dispose()` | Close the handle and unload the library |

`Rope` implements `IDisposable`. Use a `using` block or call `Dispose()` explicitly. `Rope.Interp` (1) and `Rope.Hold` (0) are the mode constants.

Errors are reported as `RopeException` with a `Code` property matching the `ROPE_ERR_*` constants above and a message that includes the error name.

## Demo

The `demo/` directory contains a Jupyter notebook that benchmarks ROPE against NRLMSIS-2.1 atmospheric drag across two scenarios: forecast and interpolation throughput (24-hour forecast, 10,000 random point queries), and a 1-day ISS-like orbit integration comparing altitude decay between the two models.

Running the demo scrips is **not** required to use any of the rope library, but may be beneficial as a sanity check to ensure your system is functioning.

To set it up, install the demo dependencies from the archive root:

```
bash demo/install.sh
```

This requires Python 3.8+ and `pip`. It installs the Python wrapper from `python/` and the demo support library from `demo/`. The notebook fetches space weather data from CelesTrak on first run and caches it locally, so an internet connection is needed the first time.

Then open the notebook:

```
bash demo/run_benchmark.sh
```

The notebook uses `demo/rope.conf`, which is pre-configured to point at the `data/` directory in the standard archive layout. If you extracted the archive somewhere else, edit the paths in that file before running.
